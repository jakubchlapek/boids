# Boids Simulation in Scala

This is a basic implementation of a Boids simulation (flocking behavior) written in Scala. It uses core Scala for the simulation logic and ScalaFX for rendering the visuals.

The goal was to explore how simple rules can lead to complex, emergent behavior â€” and to get more comfortable with Scala and GUI development.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of boid flocking behavior
- Adjustable parameters for speed, perception radius, etc.
- Simple ScalaFX GUI for visualization

## Requirements

- Scala (version 2.13.x or compatible)
- sbt (Scala Build Tool)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scala-boids-sim.git
cd scala-boids-sim
```

2. Run with sbt:

```bash
sbt run
```

## TODO

- Akka-based implementation for better concurrency and scalability
